# POINTERS FOR THE EXAM:
- IAM is globally resilient, meaning any data is secure across all AWS regions.
- object sizes can be 0 to 5TB.
- Bucket names are globally unique.
- all bucketnames should be 3 to 63 chars. lowercase or number to start.
- 100 buckets per aws account (soft limit) upto 1000 buckets (hard limit). If we have a lot of users, we can have prefixes to indicate the owner of content in a bucket, thereby allowing many users to use a single bucket.
- ARNs uniquely identify a resource within AWS.
- AWS are responsible for the security of the cloud, the user/customer is responsible for security in the cloud. 
- Policy document priority: explicit DENY, explicit ALLOW, default DENY.
- max of 5000 IAM users per account. For large no. users (eg. large companies / merges) we use IAM roles, not one user per person.
- an IAM user can only be in <= 10 IAM groups.
- cloudtrail is NOT REALTIME, there may be a 15 min delay for data to appear in s3 or cw logs. 
- For working inside one account, identity policies are better than resource policies. When we want to control access to a resource bt identities from diff accounts, resource policies are better. 
- Versioning on a bucket, once enabled can never be disabled. Only suspending a bucket is possible atp.
- S3 buckets having dots in their name and not conforming to DNS norms cannot be transfer accelerated. 
- KMS provides a FIPS 140-2 Level 2 security standard.
