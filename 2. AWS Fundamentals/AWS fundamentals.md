- Public vs Private Services

## Public v Private Services
- **TLDR**: There are 3 different network zones: Public internet, AWS public zones, AWS private zones. 
    - AWS public zones host public services that can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection and permissions (eg: S3). AWS public zones are connected to the internet, not a part of it.
    - AWS private zone hosts VPCs which hosts private services. These services can only be accessed from inside the VPC and by connecting to it.
