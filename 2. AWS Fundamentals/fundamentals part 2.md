## TOPICS COVERED
- CloudFormation
- Cloudwatch

## CloudFormation
- Lets you create, update and delete infrastructure using <ins>templates</ins> on AWS.
- Templates can be reused to make/delete/updates resources much faster than when done manually.
- Templates are written in YAML or JSON.

- **Components of a template**:
    - Resources: that is what tells cloudformation what to do (Create/Update/Delete). This is the only mandatory part of the template.
    - Description: allows the author add a description about what the template does. If we have a <ins>template format version</ins> (another field), the description must follow it.
    - Metadata: controls the UI, among others.
    - Parameters: Fields that prompt the user for more info, we can add criteria and default values of those parameters too.
    - Mapping: allows lookup tables to be made. 
    - Conditions: Allows decision making in the template - certain things only occur when conditions are met. 
    - Outputs: once the template is made, we see outputs to show what is created / updated or deleted. For example, an instance ID of an EC2 instance that is made.

- The example template used for the demo is in the same folder labeled ec2instance.yaml

## Cloudwatch
- A product that collects and manages operational data.
- Main functions include:
    - Metrics collection via cloudwatch allows also for monitoring and actions based on data collected.
    - Cloudwatch logs allows collection, monitoring and actions based on log data.
    - Cloudwatch events that allows for event generation based on an occurring event (EC2 instance stopped for example), or a timed event (thing to do on a day of the week, for example).

The above image shows the architecture of cloudwatch basics. CPU, memory and disk utliziation are some metrics that we can collect. Based on these, we can perform actions.

- Namespace: a container that is used to organize data by metrics. All AWS data go into a namespace called AWS/servicename. We can use cloudwatch for our own data and create namespaces of our own. these namespaces will contain the related metrics 

- Metrics: a collection of related datapoints in a time ordered structure. For example, we could have a metric called CPU-utilization, that takes datapoints from EC2 instances to indicate what percentage of the CPU is being utlizied by each instance. Each instance would send in 1 datapoint at fixed intervals.

- Datapoint: contains a timestamp (down to the second) and a value (related to whatever metric the datapoint speaks about).

- Alarms: Created and configured to a metric. We can say that some things are not ok, which would trigger the alarm. Based on the trigger, an action is performed. Eg: the billing alarm we make. The third state of an alarm (ok/alarm) is insufficient data.
