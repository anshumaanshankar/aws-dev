# POINTERS FOR THE EXAM:
- IAM is globally resilient, meaning any data is secure across all AWS regions.
- object sizes can be 0 to 5TB
- Bucket names are globally unique
- all bucketnames should be 3 to 63 chars. lowercase or number to start
- 100 buckets per aws account (soft limit) upto 1000 buckets (hard limit). If we have a lot of users, we can have prefixes to indicate the owner of content in a bucket, thereby allowing many users to use a single bucket.
- ARNs uniquely identify a resource within AWS
